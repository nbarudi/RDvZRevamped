# RDvZRevamped

This is a recreation of the 1.2.5 version of Dwarves Vs Zombies.

(Disclamer: Since classes started Development will be delayed until my schedule opens up)

## Notes:

### This is the recreation of my original RDvZ Project. The reasoning behind starting from scratch on the newest version was based solely on the old code being too messy for me to fix it into a useable state.

### If you for some reason want to view and use the old code for your own games / projects, feel free to check it out [Here](https://github.com/nbarudi/RetroDwarvesVsZombies)
### As well note that the original version of this game will not be updated in any way for the reasons stated above as well in the original repo.
### Finally, if you wish to use this code to create your own version of the game, feel free. I am always happy to see peoples creations and if you have the skills to finish your own custom verison I would love to check it out!
